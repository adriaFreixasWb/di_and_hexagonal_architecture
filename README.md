# Dependency Injection and Hexagonal Architecture
On this session we are going to tackle Dependency Injection and Hexagonal architecture based on the premise of [Clean code solid principles repo](https://github.com/bilelmsekni/CleanCode-Katas/tree/master/dotNet/SolidPrinciples)

## Overview

1. Create project with dotnet command line
2. Use API as an entry point to solve to the supermarket discount application
3. Dependency injection

### Create a project with dotnet command line

We are going to create a custom solution structure to fit in the principles of [Hexagonal architecture](https://netflixtechblog.com/ready-for-changes-with-hexagonal-architecture-b315ec967749) for further information check [this blog post](https://afreixasblog.wordpress.com/2021/05/04/creating-custom-solution-structures/)


We will create: 
* solution at the root folder
* src folder and presentation inside
* webapi project in src/presentation
